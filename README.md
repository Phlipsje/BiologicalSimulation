# Continuum: a Three Dimensional Continuous Space Microbial Simulation Framework
Continuum is a libray written in C# made to help biologists in making fast simulations with little effort.
It helps the user by handling collision checks, nearest neighbour-, and search queries quickly by making use of acceleration structures.
It also handles the core simulation loop and assists with writing results to disk.
Above all Continuum can be run in any C# framework, with pre built implementations for 3D in OpenTK, 2D in Monogame, and a standalone console application all work out of the box.

Some example projects are included to help get you started.

Continuum has been developed at Utrecht University by Karel Boerstoel, Kaan Pagie and Philip Tap as an honours assignment for the Computer Science department.
